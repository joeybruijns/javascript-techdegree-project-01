# Random Quote Generator
### Javascript Techdegree Project 01

For this first project, I'll create an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked, or a set amount of time has passed. 

I'll practice my basic JavaScript skills with variables, loops, conditionals and object literals. The requirements are as follows:
- Build the array of quote objects to store the quotes
- Write functions for selecting random quotes from the array and printing them to the screen.
- Write a function for dynamically changing the background color.
- Make sure the quotes also change automatically when a set amount of time has passed.
